# Giftastic

Uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs, and JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML.

## To Do
* Styling and UI elements
* Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.
* Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
   * Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
* List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.
* Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.
* Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio
* Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
   * This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
   * If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
